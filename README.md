# WaspLib Setup Instructions

## Option A: Manual Installation

1. Run any WaspLib script at least once (to download Assets)
2. Paste directories `Data` & `Includes` in your root Simba folder and say yes to overwrite. (This will disable auto-updating to allow us to use custom JSONs)
3. Delete `/Data/Cache/map/` to make sure WaspLib loads our new updated JSONs

## Option B: Automated Installation

1. Run any WaspLib script at least once (to download Assets)
2. Run the executable or the equivalent Python script from your Simba folder
3. Click buttons 1, 2, 3, 4 in order
4. Use restore buttons if you need to update or whatever
